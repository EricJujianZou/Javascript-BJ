Javascript practice 1 - BlackJack Game
I followed a Scrimba tutorial to make a web-based black jack game using HTML, CSS, and JS. 
I practiced writing down my logic in JS, adjusting to a different syntax, and linking between HTML and JS files.
I liked how the JS is similar to Java's with a much simpler syntax. 
I also appreciate the break from C++ pointers knowing that I'm working on frontend dev.
